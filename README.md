# Project-1 Title: COVID Date Night

## Description
Amidst the COVID pandemic, there are tons of couples quickly running out of ideas of what to do. We've created an app to help the user decide on an at home date night to keep from going stir-crazy while stuck at home.

It will contain three major components to create a fun date night at home.  Third-party APIs will be used to select top-rated movies, food recipes, and drink recipes.  The user is then taken through a series of questions prompting them to make a selection of a movie, food recipe, and drink recipe. Once selections are made, user will be taken to a page that sumarizes the date night of their choice with selected options and has the option to email or save as pdf.

## User Story
As a mindful couple staying at home during the COVID pandemic, I am looking for new food and beverage to try and new movies to watch.  
I would like an app to generate top rated movies and recipes so that I am able to enjoy my evening.
